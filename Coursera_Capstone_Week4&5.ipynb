    "In this project, we focus on the relationship between characteristics of neighbourhoods and crimes in Tornoto. To define the attributes of neighbourhoods, I use the proportion recommended venues (the raw number of venues may differ for given different radius) as a proxy and cluster the neighbourhoods. After so, the regression model, particularly the logistic model would be implemented to estimate and examine the probability of being high-risk (indexes shall be explain and define through crime data in the later section) when clustered in specific groups. The study should provide some intuition and suggestion for new start-ups of businesses, and meanwhile, it is capable to provide policy suggestions for the build of police and social safety system."
